My name is Trevor Bushnell. I did my undergraduate studies at Gonzaga Unviersity where I major in a BS of Applied Mathematics with a Statistics concentration, a BA of Music, and minors in Data Science and Leadership Studies. I'm interested in entering the field of data as either a data scientist or data analyst. Numbers and statistics are fascinating to me, but I don't want numbers and math to be scary for everyone. With data science, I have the opportunity to bring an understanding of statistics to organizations to leverage smarter business decisions and stronger products. Currently, I am working on my senior honors thesis on **Singable Choral AI** where I use both data science and human voices to analyze whether AIs that can re-generate Bach chorales are able to be easily sung. I have had professional experience as both a data scientist and a software developer.

Teaching is something that I find immense joy in. To fill this joy, I was involved as a math tutor at Gonzaga's Math Learning Center. Here, I serve students in the afternoons/evenings to help them complete their coursework or study for an important exam/final. I also maintain a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2G7S_EuUryTVKe1C5VXCdQ) and [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/trevorbushnell) channel where I continue to teach and influence students across the world. My everything you need to know about AP Calculus video on my YouTube channel has now amassed over 40,000 views and has received incredibly positive comments from students who have gone on to get passing scores (and many 5s) on the AP Calculus exams. While my YouTube channel used to be Khan-Academy like in nature, I've shifted the channel into more of a content creation channel. This allows me to teach about individual topics in math, data science, and other technologies that I find interesting. 

Outside of teaching and doing my schoolwork, I am a singer and huge choir nerd. I devote most of my extracurricular time to singing for various choirs within the Gonzaga music department, including the Concert Choir, Chamber Choir, and Glee Club. I had the opportunity to serve as the interim tenor section leader for Concert Choir in Spring 2022 as well as serve as the Logistics Coordinator for the entire program this coming year. While being a part of these choirs, I've had the opportunity to sing solos in various famous works, including Bach's famous *Magnificat* as well as the *Misa Criolla*, a spanish rendition of the Catholic mass. I'm also the co-founder and artistic director of [Concordanza](https://concordanza.github.io), an octet made up of singers from Gonzaga's Concert Choir. With this group, we sing a variety of a-capella choir songs from Renaissance classics to contemporary masterpieces. I also am a semi-professional singer in the greater Spokane area, singing for various churches and choirs in the area - including the upcoming season with the Spokane Symphony Chorale. Finally, I take private lessons where I hone my technique and skills. I'm currently trained as a tenor, but I'm also learning the countertenor voice part to give myself some additional challenge and excitement in my singing.
