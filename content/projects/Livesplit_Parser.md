Speedrunning is a massive hobby that I have participated in since June of 2020. I have tried to speedrun many games over the last few years, and as a result I have many various attempts completed. Being the math and numbers guy I am, I wanted a way to be able to analyze the data in my speedruns. While many people have provided tools to do this, no one has had a library that lets me pull the data out of my speedrun timer files cleanly, easily, and programmatically. 

Introducing `livesplit-parser` - a Python library that lets you analyze your speedrunning data programmatically. The library supports the basic feature of extracting data from your livesplit files and save that data in a csv file. As I expand the library, more features will be included, such as different graphing capabilities, comparing PBs across multiple different runners, and more. 

The app is currently open-sourced, and Pull Requests are welcome if you wish to contribute to the project! You can find the codebase and more information about the library by [visiting the repository](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/livesplit_parser).
