*NOTE: This website was created when I was pursuing data science. I'm now an aspiring choral music educator, and you can find out more information about my current professional developments over on my [main portfolio site](https://TrevorBushnell.github.io).*

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring data scientist that uses Python, R, and Julia to do my data science and computational mathematics tasks!

#### Interests
I am a huge numbers geek and love to analyze and interpret data. While this is my main career focus, I also occasionally develop on projects for the speedrunning community, including simple bingo generators and trackers for speedruns and a library for speedrunners to analyze their own data. Additionally, I'm super passionate about computational musicology - i.e. how we can use computer programming to analyze many scores to find trends in music in a much faster and efficient manner than through reading scores by hand.

#### Projects List

* **Honors Thesis: Analyzing the Singability of Choral AI** (complete, adding new insights as time permits)
* **`livesplit-parser`: A Python library for analyzing speedrunning data (in development, [open source](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/livesplit_parser))** 
* **Gonzaga Choirs Digital Library Web App** (currently in development)
* **Splatoon 3 Personal Battle Data Dashboard** (under a dev rehaul)
* **STEM-Notes** (complete for now)
* **School Data Science Projects** (completed)
* **Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Custom Cup Generator** (completed)
