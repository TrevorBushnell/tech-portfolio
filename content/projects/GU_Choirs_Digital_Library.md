title: "Gonzaga Choirs Digital Library: A Webapp"
---

While I can't link the source code because of the private information being managed, I built an online webapp and small database for managing our entire choral catalog for all the choirs at Gonzaga per the direction of our director Dr. Meg Stohlmann. This was a satisfying project for me because I was able to combine my love of programming and problem solving with choir. The final project is able to serve the choral community long after I graduate college. 

Tasks included:

* Cleaning and building a new dataset containing all the music in our current physical library
* Allow a user to filter music based on different features, such as composer, arranger, voicing, presence of a solo, etc.
* Allow a user to add, edit, and delete songs from the choral library
* Allow the director to generate JS Bach chorales for sight-reading purposes
