This was a team project where I worked with Ben Lombardi (Gonzaga class of 2023) to see if we could figure out the winning player in a League of Legends match based on data collected in the first 10 minutes of the match. This project was completed for my CPSC322: Data Science Algorithms class. 

> [Check out the report](https://github.com/TrevorBushnell/League-Game-Prediction-Project)

Tasks included:

* Communicating with team members to develop a cohesive project and presentation
* Build popular machine learning algorithms (kNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest) by hand
* Produce visualizations that helped provide insights into the dataset and helped us choose what attributes to train on
* Communicated these insights in the form of a report and presented the findings to the class and professor
