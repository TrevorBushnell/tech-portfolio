My friends know that I am such a choir nerd and exclusively listen to choir on Spotify. As such, it was a massive surprise when I looked at my 2023 Spotify Wrapped to find that my #2 artist for the year was Travis Scott. I was shocked and bewildered - how does a rapper make it into my Spotify Wrapped surrounded by multitudes of choir music? To figure some things out, I asked for my Spotify data and did a short data science project looking for my findings. 

[Check out the final report here](https://TrevorBushnell.github.io/WhyTravisScott/WhyTravisScott.html)

Tasks include:

* Using `pandas` and `matplotlib` to quickly generate some insights into my experience with Travis Scott the previous year
* Wrote a report using Jupyter notebooks and `jupyter-book` with GitHub Pages to post the article to the internet for people to read
