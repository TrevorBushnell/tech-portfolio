title: "Honors Thesis: Analyzing the Singability of Choir AI"
---

This was my first data science project. It was created and presented as my final project in my CPSC222: Intro to Data Science class. In 2021, I was invested in improving my typing speeds. Since I had so much typing data, I was interested in seeing what my progress was like over time.

Tasks included:

* Listen to many Bach compositions and do research to figure out what makes Bach unique
* Find, train, and run Bach AI models on my machine
* Use my music theory and data science skills to analyze the differences between AI Bach and real Bach compositions
* Write a paper/website that explains all the discoveries that I made
* Direct a chamber choir of music and honors students from Gonzaga university to perform the AI Music in March 2024
