This was my first data science project. It was created and presented as my final project in my CPSC222: Intro to Data Science class. In 2021, I was invested in improving my typing speeds. Since I had so much typing data, I was interested in seeing what my progress was like over time.

Tasks included:

* Scraping for my data on the typing test website I used (the data was not easily downloadable at the time I did this project)
* Creating visualizations that showed my typing improvements over time
* Developed a simple machine learning model that predicted the threshold of my typing speeds based on other typing factors
* Communicated these insights in the form of a report and presented my findings to the class and professor
