title: "Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Custom Cup Generator"
---

My best videogame hands down has to be Mario Kart. I absolutely love this game and I play it constantly on my own. One day, my roommate and I played through every track in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for the Switch and ranked them in a tier list. It was quite the fun activity on a chill weekend. 

However, when we just wanted to play the game normally, we had a hard time picking tracks. We started using random, but we didn't like how often we got tracks that we didn't like. This led me to quickly spin up this web app - a custom Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Cup Generator!

The cup generator is very simple - it generates 4 tracks for us to play. However, there is a weighted probability system implemented based on the tier list that we created - this means that tracks we prefer to play are more likely to be chosen. If we get a track we don't like, we can reroll a certain number of times. There's also a feature to generate a custom character/kart combination for you to optionally race with too! This was a nice web app for me to spin up in an hour to allow us to play Mario Kart without having to think about what tracks we want to play.
